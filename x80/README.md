### Simplistic converter from MPC 80 column to XML

This is more of a demo than usable program.  It converts a small file of
80 column observations, the sample observations included with digest2,
to an XML file that validates by the current example.xsd.

It probably shouldn't grow up to support all the complexity possible in the
80 column format, but still it might be useful as an example of doing
something quick and dirty.
